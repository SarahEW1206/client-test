            <p class="detail">I designed and built this site for a final project in a web development class. Unfortunately it's not hosted
                live, because the database is not compatible with my current hosting platform. However, I wanted to share
                some images that highlight the design and explain the functionality. </p>
            <p class="detail">The site allows the user to add items to a baby registry of sorts. Items entered in the user interface are saved
                in a database, and are able to be edited and deleted. Each item is displayed in main list page, as well as
                its own detail page. Items can be sorted by what's been purchased and what is still needed.</p>
